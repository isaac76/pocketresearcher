Idea: -\x01{1.0} = (1 + \x01{1.0-1})\approx 1.0 -\x01{1.0-1} = 1.0 \approx 2.0 -\x01{1.0-1} = (3 + \x01{1.0-1})\approx 2.0 -\x01{1.0-1} = 3.0 \approx 2

Fact: they are integers not divisible by 2.. Odd numbers are integers not divisible by 2.. Odd numbers are integers not divisible by 2.. Odd numbers are integers not divisible by 2.. Odd numbers are integers not divisible by 2.. Odd numbers are integers not divisible by 2..
Idea: For instance, when you have an even number, its square root should be equal to the square root of 2. If you have a square root, it should be the square root of the even number. So, for instance, when you have the number 3, the square root should be 3/4. If you have a square root, it should be a/4, and so on. This formula is the first step in proof of even number properties.

Fact: there exists a set of odd numbers and a set of even numbers. A number is odd if it is odd and thus its sum odd. A set of even numbers is, on the other hand, odd if it is even and thus its sum odd. But when we add these two facts together, what we are left with is a set of odd numbers which, like the set of even numbers, are divisible by 2. A set of even numbers is, on the other hand, divisible
Idea: It is possible to prove properties of even numbers by finding odd numbers by brute force. For instance, suppose you have a number N that is even, and you find its square root to be 1. It is possible to brute force it to 1.3, with a probability of 0.1. If you find the square root of N to be 1.3, then you can use this formula to prove that N is even. It is not possible to find any even numbers with the same square

Fact: A. The prime factor of even numbers is an odd integer.
Idea: For instance, when you have an even number, its square root should be equal to the square root of 2. If you have a square root, it should be the square root of the even number. So, for instance, when you have the number 3, the square root should be 3/4. If you have a square root, it should be a/4, and so on.
