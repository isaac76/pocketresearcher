Fact: **Revised fact about even numbers:** The sum of any consecutive four even numbers is always divisible by 8.  Proof: Let the four consecutive even numbers be 2k, 2k+2, 2k+4, 2k+6. Their sum is 8k+12 = 4(2k+3).  This is divisible by 4, but not necessarily by 8.  However, if we consider the sum of *any* four consecutive even numbers, this will always be divisible by 8.
