Fact: Dynamic programming is based on the idea that there are two distinct types of programming that can be written. The first is the generic language, the second is the special language, namely a special case for the "real" language. The former is an interesting idea. Â In fact, it is actually one of the world's most popular techniques. (And it is also one of the more valuable for the programmer when trying to understand the language.) We all know how to program, but no one
Idea: - solve a polynomial problem on a small dataset. Use the same data as before, except that the solution must be less than 2x2 times the problem size, and the problem is solved by applying the same approach to the dataset. Now, for a polynomial problem, use the following:
