"""
Implementation Validation - Confirms the project meets core requirements

Requirements from user:
1. Query an LLM with questions about specific math questions
2. Take responses and form a proof that we can provide to Lean  
3. Lean validates our proof and tells us if we proved the theorem or not
4. If we prove it, we're done. If not, use the response to inform our next query
5. Repeat this process and hopefully solve easier problems with known solutions

This script validates each component works as expected.
