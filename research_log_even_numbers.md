Fact: Answer 1: A new fact about even numbers is that their sum is always divisible by 4. This is because of the additive property of even numbers, which states that the sum of any two even numbers is always an even number. This means that the sum of any two even numbers can be expressed as 2n+2m, where n and m are integers. Since 2 is a common factor of both n and m, the sum can be rewritten as 2(n+m
Idea: Proof: Let's consider the sum of any two even numbers, where x and y are even numbers. By definition, an even number is divisible by 2, so x = 2a and y = 2b, where a and b are integers. The sum of x and y can be expressed as x + y = 2a + 2b = 2(a + b). Since a + b is an integer, the sum of any two even numbers is always a multiple of 2, which

Fact: While the statement you provided contains some correct information about even numbers, the claim that "the sum of even numbers is always divisible by 4" is not universally true. Let's clarify this and state a correct fact about even numbers and their sums:
Idea: Let's prove that the product of any two even numbers is always divisible by 4. We can formalize this in Lean 4 as follows:

Fact: Thank you for pointing out the error in the previous statement. You're right that the sum of even numbers is not always divisible by 4. Let me provide a correct fact about even numbers and their sums:
Idea: Let's prove that the sum of the squares of two consecutive even numbers is always divisible by 4. This is an interesting property that combines both addition and multiplication of even numbers. We can formalize this in Lean 4 as follows:
