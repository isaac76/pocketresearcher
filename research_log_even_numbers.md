Fact: Answer 1: A new fact about even numbers is that their sum is always divisible by 4. This is because of the additive property of even numbers, which states that the sum of any two even numbers is always an even number. This means that the sum of any two even numbers can be expressed as 2n+2m, where n and m are integers. Since 2 is a common factor of both n and m, the sum can be rewritten as 2(n+m
Idea: Proof: Let's consider the sum of any two even numbers, where x and y are even numbers. By definition, an even number is divisible by 2, so x = 2a and y = 2b, where a and b are integers. The sum of x and y can be expressed as x + y = 2a + 2b = 2(a + b). Since a + b is an integer, the sum of any two even numbers is always a multiple of 2, which
