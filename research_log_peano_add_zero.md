Fact: * **`theorem add_comm ...`:** This is the crucial theorem proving the commutativity of addition.  The proof uses induction on `m` as suggested in your strategy.  The `induction m with m IH` line starts the induction.  The `case zero` and `case succ` handle the base case and inductive step respectively.  `simp` simplifies expressions using the definitions of `add`.  `rw` rewrites expressions using previously proven theorems or equations.  Finally, `refl` states that the left and right sides are equal.
Idea: This example provides a clear and concise demonstration of how to formally define Peano arithmetic and prove a fundamental property like addition commutativity within the Lean 4 proof assistant.  It's a foundational example that can be expanded upon to explore more complex concepts in arithmetic and beyond.
